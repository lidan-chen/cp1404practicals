What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?
- I have watched seventy percent of lecture videos, completing most initial modules. I maintain consistency by scheduling sessions biweekly, ensuring thorough coverage and understanding of foundational Python concepts before progressing.

What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?
- I have scheduled daily study sessions from 8 to 8:30 PM in my room, dedicating one hour each evening to watch lecture videos. This routine enhances my focus and retention.

What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
- I consistently review lecture notes after each class and actively practice coding challenges daily. This approach reinforces my understanding of Python fundamentals and problem-solving techniques, so I will maintain it.

What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
- I need to stop postponing assignments until the last minute and improve my time management. I will create a schedule and begin tasks earlier to significantly reduce stress, enhance quality.

What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?
- I struggle with writing clear, well-documented code for practical assignments. I often skip comments and explanations. To improve, I will focus on adding meaningful comments, organizing code logically, testing thoroughly.

What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?
- I excel at breaking problems into smaller functions and writing modular code for practical exercises. I consistently test edge cases, use version control, and refactor code for readability, enhancing outputs.
